# Flash-Card-Quizzes (Week 4 Homework Project)

## Description

This was built to get a better grasp on using JavaScript to dynamically update the DOM, respond to user interactions, and manage application state.
I learned how to mimic having multiple pages. I had always assumed setting something up like this with multiple quiz options was done with multiple webpages, but it can actually just be updated easily with the use of JavaScript.

## Usage

If for any reason you would like to return to the original selection page, you can do so by refreshing the webpage. However the buttons in the nav bar will serve the same purpose in letting you change quizzes.
